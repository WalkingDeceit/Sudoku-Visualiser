## Algorithm
Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying 
to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that 
fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, 
is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).
